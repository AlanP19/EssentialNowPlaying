# OBS Now Playing
A now playing tool intended to be used with OBS.

So bascially its just something that I made to replace SMG. I'll be adding functionality for soem more major media players in the coming weeks. If anyone actually sees this and wants to request a player, just make an issue. 

Planned players to support:
* Spotify (done)
* iTunes (done)
* winamp (done)
* VLC (done)
* MPC-HC (done)
* YouTube in Chrome or Firefox (depending on how hard it is)
